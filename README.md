# mail-sender
This plugin allows you to set a custom mail sender for WordPress. Instead of the default mail sender carrying the WordPress name, you can set the mail sender to your website name and set a custom email address as the "from" email address. This is useful but not limited to the following reasons:

- You don't want people to know you are using WordPress as your website content management system :D
- You don't want mail providers flagging your emails and sending them to spam due to the presence of parenthesis or not properly formatted mail sender names.
- You want to improve your website and email reputation
Of course, this is just our own view. There may be more reasons. :D

This plugin is a fork of the original plugin CB Change Email Sender. Kudos to them. Please donate to them by clicking their donation link
