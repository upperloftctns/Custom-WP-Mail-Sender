# Custom WP Mail Sender
This plugin allows you to set a custom mail sender for WordPress. Instead of the default mail sender carrying the WordPress name, you can set the mail sender to your website name and set a custom email address as the "from" email address. This is useful but not limited to the following reasons:

1. You don't want people to know you are using WordPress as your website content management system :D
2. You don't want mail providers flagging your emails and sending them to spam due to the presence of parenthesis or not properly formatted mail sender names.
3. You want to improve your website and email reputation
Of course, this is just our own view. There may be more reasons. :D

This plugin is a fork of the original plugin CB Change Email Sender (http://www.codingbank.com). Kudos to them. Please donate to them by clicking their donation link: http://donate.codingbank.com
